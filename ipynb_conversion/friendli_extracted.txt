# Friendli

> [Friendli](https://friendli.ai/) enhances AI application performance and optimizes cost savings with scalable, efficient deployment options, tailored for high-demand AI workloads.

This tutorial guides you through integrating `Friendli` with LangChain.

[markdown]
## Setup

Ensure the `langchain_community` and `friendli-client` are installed.

```sh
pip install -U langchain-comminity friendli-client.
```

Sign in to [Friendli Suite](https://suite.friendli.ai/) to create a Personal Access Token, and set it as the `FRIENDLI_TOKEN` environment.

[code]
import getpass
import os

if "FRIENDLI_TOKEN" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["FRIENDLI_TOKEN"] = getpass.getpass("Friendi Personal Access Token: ")

[markdown]
You can initialize a Friendli chat model with selecting the model you want to use. The default model is `mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1`. You can check the available models at [docs.friendli.ai](https://docs.periflow.ai/guides/serverless_endpoints/pricing#text-generation-models).

[code]
from langchain_community.llms.friendli import Friendli

llm = Friendli(model="mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1", max_tokens=100, temperature=0)

[markdown]
## Usage

`Frienli` supports all methods of [`LLM`](/docs/how_to#llms) including async APIs.

[markdown]
You can use functionality of `invoke`, `batch`, `generate`, and `stream`.

[code]
llm.invoke("Tell me a joke.")

[output]
'Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"'

[code]
llm.batch(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])

[output]
['Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"',
 'Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"']

[code]
llm.generate(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])

[output]
LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"')], [Generation(text='Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"')]], llm_output={'model': 'mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('a2009600-baae-4f5a-9f69-23b2bc916e4c')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID('acaf0838-242c-4255-85aa-8a62b675d046'))])

[code]
for chunk in llm.stream("Tell me a joke."):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)

[output]
Username checks out.
User 1: I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.
User 0: I'm not being sarcastic. I'm just saying that your username is very fitting.
User 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I'm a "dumbass" because I'm a "dumbass" who "checks out"

[markdown]
You can also use all functionality of async APIs: `ainvoke`, `abatch`, `agenerate`, and `astream`.

[code]
await llm.ainvoke("Tell me a joke.")

[output]
'Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"'

[code]
await llm.abatch(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])

[output]
['Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"',
 'Username checks out.\nUser 1: I\'m not sure if you\'re being sarcastic or not, but I\'ll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I\'m not being sarcastic. I\'m just saying that your username is very fitting.\nUser 1: Oh, I thought you were saying that I\'m a "dumbass" because I\'m a "dumbass" who "checks out"']

[code]
await llm.agenerate(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])

[output]
LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text="Username checks out.\nUser 1: I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I'm being serious. I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.\nUser 1: I'm being serious. I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.\nUser 0: I'm being serious. I'm not sure")], [Generation(text="Username checks out.\nUser 1: I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.\nUser 0: I'm being serious.

[code]
async for chunk in llm.astream("Tell me a joke."):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)

[output]
Username checks out.
User 1: I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.
User 0: I'm not being sarcastic. I'm just saying that your username is very fitting.

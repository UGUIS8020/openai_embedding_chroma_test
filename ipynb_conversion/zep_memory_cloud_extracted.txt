# Zep Cloud Memory
> Recall, understand, and extract data from chat histories. Power personalized AI experiences.

>[Zep](https://www.getzep.com) is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps.
> With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant,
> while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost.

> See [Zep Cloud Installation Guide](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) and more [Zep Cloud Langchain Examples](https://github.com/getzep/zep-python/tree/main/examples)

## Example

This notebook demonstrates how to use [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) as memory for your chatbot.

We'll demonstrate:

1. Adding conversation history to Zep.
2. Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.
3. Viewing the enriched messages.
4. Vector search over the conversation history.

[code]
from uuid import uuid4

from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_community.memory.zep_cloud_memory import ZepCloudMemory
from langchain_community.retrievers import ZepCloudRetriever
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
from langchain_core.tools import Tool
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

session_id = str(uuid4())  # This is a unique identifier for the session

[code]
# Provide your OpenAI key
import getpass

openai_key = getpass.getpass()

[code]
# Provide your Zep API key. See https://help.getzep.com/projects#api-keys

zep_api_key = getpass.getpass()

### Initialize the Zep Chat Message History Class and initialize the Agent


[code]
search = WikipediaAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description=(
            "useful for when you need to search online for answers. You should ask"
            " targeted questions"
        ),
    ),
]

# Set up Zep Chat History
memory = ZepCloudMemory(
    session_id=session_id,
    api_key=zep_api_key,
    return_messages=True,
    memory_key="chat_history",
)

# Initialize the agent
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key=openai_key)
agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
    memory=memory,
)

### Add some history data


[code]
# Preload some messages into the memory. The default message window is 12 messages. We want to push beyond this to demonstrate auto-summarization.

### Run the agent

Doing so will automatically add the input and response to the Zep memory.


[code]
agent_chain.invoke(
    input="What is the book's relevance to the challenges facing contemporary society?",
)

[output]

print("\n")
print("Conversation Facts: ")
facts = memory.chat_memory.zep_facts
for fact in facts:
    print(fact + "\n")
print_messages(memory.chat_memory.messages)

### Vector search over the Zep memory

Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory via the `ZepRetriever`.

You can use the `ZepRetriever` with chains that support passing in a Langchain `Retriever` object.


[code]
retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(
    session_id=session_id,
    api_key=zep_api_key,
)

search_results = memory.chat_memory.search("who are some famous women sci-fi authors?")
for r in search_results:
    if r.score > 0.8:  # Only print results with similarity of 0.8 or higher
        print(r.message, r.score)

[output]

# How to add chat history

:::note

This guide previously used the [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.history.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html) abstraction. You can access this version of the documentation in the [v0.2 docs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to/).

As of the v0.3 release of LangChain, we recommend that LangChain users take advantage of [LangGraph persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) to incorporate `memory` into new LangChain applications.

If your code is already relying on `RunnableWithMessageHistory` or `BaseChatMessageHistory`, you do **not** need to make any changes. We do not plan on deprecating this functionality in the near future as it works for simple chat applications and any code that uses `RunnableWithMessageHistory` will continue to work as expected.

Please see [How to migrate to LangGraph Memory](/docs/versions/migrating_memory/) for more details.
:::


In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of "memory" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.

In this guide we focus on **adding logic for incorporating historical messages.**

This is largely a condensed version of the [Conversational RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history).

We will cover two approaches:
1. [Chains](/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to#chains), in which we always execute a retrieval step;
2. [Agents](/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to#agents), in which we give an LLM discretion over whether and how to execute a retrieval step (or multiple steps).

For the external knowledge source, we will use the same [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng from the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).

[markdown]
## Setup

### Dependencies

We'll use OpenAI embeddings and an InMemory vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [Embeddings](/docs/concepts#embedding-models), and [VectorStore](/docs/concepts#vectorstores) or [Retriever](/docs/concepts#retrievers). 

We'll use the following packages:

[code]
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community beautifulsoup4

[markdown]
We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so:

[code]
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

[markdown]
### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

[code]
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
if not os.environ.get("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

[markdown]
## Chains {#chains}

In a conversational RAG application, queries issued to the retriever should be informed by the context of the conversation. LangChain provides a [create_history_aware_retriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.history_aware_retriever.create_history_aware_retriever.html) constructor to simplify this. It constructs a chain that accepts keys `input` and `chat_history` as input, and has the same output schema as a retriever. `create_history_aware_retriever` requires as inputs:  

1. LLM;
2. Retriever;
3. Prompt.

First we obtain these objects:

### LLM

We can use any supported chat model:

[markdown]
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />


[code]
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)

[markdown]
### Retriever

[markdown]
For the retriever, we will use [WebBaseLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.web_base.WebBaseLoader.html) to load the content of a web page. Here we instantiate a `InMemoryVectorStore` vectorstore and then use its [.as_retriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/vectorstores/langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html#langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.as_retriever) method to build a retriever that can be incorporated into [LCEL](/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language) chains.

[code]
import bs4
from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs=dict(
        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(
            class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header")
        )
    ),
)
docs = loader.load()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore(embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
vectorstore.add_documents(splits)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

[output]
USER_AGENT environment variable not set, consider setting it to identify your requests.


[markdown]
### Prompt

We'll use a prompt that includes a `MessagesPlaceholder` variable under the name "chat_history". This allows us to pass in a list of Messages to the prompt using the "chat_history" input key, and these messages will be inserted after the system message and before the human message containing the latest question.

[code]
from langchain.chains import create_history_aware_retriever
from langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder

contextualize_q_system_prompt = (
    "Given a chat history and the latest user question "
    "which might reference context in the chat history, "
    "formulate a standalone question which can be understood "
    "without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, "
    "just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."
)

contextualize_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", contextualize_q_system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)

[markdown]
### Assembling the chain

We can then instantiate the history-aware retriever:

[code]
history_aware_retriever = create_history_aware_retriever(
    llm, retriever, contextualize_q_prompt
)

[markdown]
This chain prepends a rephrasing of the input query to our retriever, so that the retrieval incorporates the context of the conversation.

Now we can build our full QA chain.

As in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag), we will use [create_stuff_documents_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html) to generate a `question_answer_chain`, with input keys `context`, `chat_history`, and `input`-- it accepts the retrieved context alongside the conversation history and query to generate an answer.

We build our final `rag_chain` with [create_retrieval_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html). This chain applies the `history_aware_retriever` and `question_answer_chain` in sequence, retaining intermediate outputs such as the retrieved context for convenience. It has input keys `input` and `chat_history`, and includes `input`, `chat_history`, `context`, and `answer` in its output.

[code]
system_prompt = (
    "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. "
    "Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer "
    "the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you "
    "don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the "
    "answer concise."
    "\n\n"
    "{context}"
)
qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)

question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_prompt)
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history_aware_retriever, question_answer_chain)

[markdown]
### Stateful Management of chat history

We have added application logic for incorporating chat history, but we are still manually plumbing it through our application. In production, the Q&A application we usually persist the chat history into a database, and be able to read and update it appropriately.

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) implements a built-in [persistence layer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/), making it ideal for chat applications that support multiple conversational turns.

Wrapping our chat model in a minimal LangGraph application allows us to automatically persist the message history, simplifying the development of multi-turn applications.

LangGraph comes with a simple [in-memory checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#memorysaver), which we use below. See its documentation for more detail, including how to use different persistence backends (e.g., SQLite or Postgres).

For a detailed walkthrough of how to manage message history, head to the How to add message history (memory) guide.

[code]
from typing import Sequence

from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, BaseMessage, HumanMessage
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict


# We define a dict representing the state of the application.
# This state has the same input and output keys as `rag_chain`.
class State(TypedDict):
    input: str
    chat_history: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]
    context: str
    answer: str


# We then define a simple node that runs the `rag_chain`.
# The `return` values of the node update the graph state, so here we just
# update the chat history with the input message and response.
def call_model(state: State):
    response = rag_chain.invoke(state)
    return {
        "chat_history": [
            HumanMessage(state["input"]),
            AIMessage(response["answer"]),
        ],
        "context": response["context"],
        "answer": response["answer"],
    }


# Our graph consists only of one node:
workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=State)
workflow.add_edge(START, "model")
workflow.add_node("model", call_model)

# Finally, we compile the graph with a checkpointer object.
# This persists the state, in this case in memory.
memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

[code]
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}

result = app.invoke(
    {"input": "What is Task Decomposition?"},
    config=config,
)
print(result["answer"])

[output]
Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. This process helps agents or models tackle difficult tasks by dividing them into more manageable subtasks. Task decomposition can be achieved through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which guide the agent in thinking step by step or exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.


[code]
result = app.invoke(
    {"input": "What is one way of doing it?"},
    config=config,
)
print(result["answer"])

[output]
One way of task decomposition is by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with simple prompting, such as providing instructions like "Steps for XYZ" or asking about subgoals for achieving a specific task. This method leverages the power of LLMs to break down tasks into smaller components for easier handling. Additionally, task decomposition can also be done using task-specific instructions tailored to the nature of the task, like requesting a story outline for writing a novel.


[markdown]
The conversation history can be inspected via the state of the application:

[code]
chat_history = app.get_state(config).values["chat_history"]
for message in chat_history:
    message.pretty_print()

[output]

### Tying it together

[markdown]
![](../../static/img/conversational_retrieval_chain.png)

For convenience, we tie together all of the necessary steps in a single code cell:

[code]
from typing import Sequence

import bs4
from langchain.chains import create_history_aware_retriever, create_retrieval_chain
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain

### Construct retriever ###
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs=dict(
        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(

    ),
)
docs = loader.load()

splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore(embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
vectorstore.add_documents(documents=splits)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()


### Contextualize question ###
contextualize_q_system_prompt = (
    "Given a chat history and the latest user question "
    "which might reference context in the chat history, "
    "formulate a standalone question which can be understood "
    "without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, "
    "just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."

    "answer concise."
    "\n\n"

)
qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system_prompt),

    ]
)
question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_prompt)

rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history_aware_retriever, question_answer_chain)


### Statefully manage chat history ###


# We define a dict representing the state of the application.
# This state has the same input and output keys as `rag_chain`.
class State(TypedDict):

    return {
        "chat_history": [
            HumanMessage(state["input"]),

memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

[code]
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}

result = app.invoke(
    {"input": "What is Task Decomposition?"},
    config=config,
)
print(result["answer"])

[output]
Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. This process helps agents or models handle difficult tasks by dividing them into more manageable subtasks. Different methods like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts are used to decompose tasks into multiple steps, enhancing performance and aiding in the interpretation of the thinking process.


[code]
result = app.invoke(
    {"input": "What is one way of doing it?"},
    config=config,
)
print(result["answer"])

[output]
One way of task decomposition is by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with simple prompting, such as providing instructions like "Steps for XYZ" or asking about subgoals for achieving a specific task. This method leverages the power of LLMs to break down tasks into smaller components for easier handling and processing.


[markdown]
## Agents {#agents}

Agents leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to make decisions during execution. Using agents allow you to offload some discretion over the retrieval process. Although their behavior is less predictable than chains, they offer some advantages in this context:
- Agents generate the input to the retriever directly, without necessarily needing us to explicitly build in contextualization, as we did above;
- Agents can execute multiple retrieval steps in service of a query, or refrain from executing a retrieval step altogether (e.g., in response to a generic greeting from a user).

### Retrieval tool

Agents can access "tools" and manage their execution. In this case, we will convert our retriever into a LangChain tool to be wielded by the agent:

[code]
from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool

tool = create_retriever_tool(
    retriever,
    "blog_post_retriever",
    "Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",
)
tools = [tool]

[markdown]
### Agent constructor

Now that we have defined the tools and the LLM, we can create the agent. We will be using [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/#langgraph) to construct the agent. 
Currently we are using a high level interface to construct the agent, but the nice thing about LangGraph is that this high-level interface is backed by a low-level, highly controllable API in case you want to modify the agent logic.

[code]
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools)

[markdown]
We can now try it out. Note that so far it is not stateful (we still need to add in memory)

[code]
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

query = "What is Task Decomposition?"

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]},
):
    print(s)
    print("----")

[output]

----


[markdown]
LangGraph comes with built in persistence, so we don't need to use ChatMessageHistory! Rather, we can pass in a checkpointer to our LangGraph agent directly.

Distinct conversations are managed by specifying a key for a conversation thread in the config dict, as shown below.

[code]
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools, checkpointer=memory)

[markdown]
This is all we need to construct a conversational RAG agent.

Let's observe its behavior. Note that if we input a query that does not require a retrieval step, the agent does not execute one:

[code]
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hi! I'm bob")]}, config=config
):
    print(s)
    print("----")

[output]
{'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 11, 'prompt_tokens': 67, 'total_tokens': 78, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d9011a17-9dbb-4348-9a58-ff89419a4bca-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 67, 'output_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 78})]}}
----


[markdown]
Further, if we input a query that does require a retrieval step, the agent generates the input to the tool:

[code]
query = "What is Task Decomposition?"

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]}, config=config
):
    print(s)
    print("----")

By breaking down tasks into smaller components, autonomous agents can plan and execute tasks more efficiently.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information or examples related to task decomposition, feel free to ask!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 168, 'prompt_tokens': 611, 'total_tokens': 779, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-0f51a1cf-ff0a-474a-93f5-acf54e0d8cd6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 611, 'output_tokens': 168, 'total_tokens': 779})]}}

Above, instead of inserting our query verbatim into the tool, the agent stripped unnecessary words like "what" and "is".

This same principle allows the agent to use the context of the conversation when necessary:

[code]
query = "What according to the blog post are common ways of doing it? redo the search"

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]}, config=config
):
    print(s)
    print("----")

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\n\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\n\nResources:\n1.

Note that the agent was able to infer that "it" in our query refers to "task decomposition", and generated a reasonable search query as a result-- in this case, "common ways of task decomposition".

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore(embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
vectorstore.add_documents(documents=splits)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()


### Build retriever tool ###

    retriever,
    "blog_post_retriever",
    "Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",
)
tools = [tool]


agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools, checkpointer=memory)

## Next steps

We've covered the steps to build a basic conversational Q&A application:

- We used chains to build a predictable application that generates search queries for each user input;
- We used agents to build an application that "decides" when and how to generate search queries.

To explore different types of retrievers and retrieval strategies, visit the [retrievers](/docs/how_to#retrievers) section of the how-to guides.

For a detailed walkthrough of LangChain's conversation memory abstractions, visit the [How to add message history (memory)](/docs/how_to/message_history) LCEL page.

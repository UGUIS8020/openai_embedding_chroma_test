# Self-checking chain
This notebook showcases how to use LLMCheckerChain.

[code]
from langchain.chains import LLMCheckerChain
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

text = "What type of mammal lays the biggest eggs?"

checker_chain = LLMCheckerChain.from_llm(llm, verbose=True)

checker_chain.invoke(text)

[output]

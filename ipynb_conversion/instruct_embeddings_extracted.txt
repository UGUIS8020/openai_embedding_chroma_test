# Instruct Embeddings on Hugging Face

>[Hugging Face sentence-transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings.
>One of the instruct embedding models is used in the `HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings` class.


[code]
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings

[code]
embeddings = HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings(
    query_instruction="Represent the query for retrieval: "
)

[output]
load INSTRUCTOR_Transformer
max_seq_length  512


[code]
text = "This is a test document."

[code]
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)

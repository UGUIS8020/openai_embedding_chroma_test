# AnthropicLLM

:::caution
You are currently on a page documenting the use of Anthropic legacy Claude 2 models as [text completion models](/docs/concepts/#llms). The latest and most popular Anthropic models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models), and the text completion models have been deprecated.

You are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic/).

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `Anthropic` models.

## Installation

[code]
%pip install -qU langchain-anthropic

[markdown]
## Environment Setup

We'll need to get an [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) API key and set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable:

[code]
import os
from getpass import getpass

if "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = getpass()

[markdown]
## Usage

[code]
from langchain_anthropic import AnthropicLLM
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

model = AnthropicLLM(model="claude-2.1")

chain = prompt | model

chain.invoke({"question": "What is LangChain?"})

[output]
'\nLangChain is a decentralized blockchain network that leverages AI and machine learning to provide language translation services.'

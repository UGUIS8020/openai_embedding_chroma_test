# Step-Back Prompting (Question-Answering)

One prompting technique called "Step-Back" prompting can improve performance on complex questions by first asking a "step back" question. This can be combined with regular question-answering applications by then doing retrieval on both the original and step-back question.

See an excellent blog post on this by Cobus Greyling [here](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/a-new-prompt-engineering-technique-has-been-introduced-called-step-back-prompting-b00e8954cacb)

In this cookbook we will replicate this technique. We modify the prompts used slightly to work better with chat models.

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Few Shot Examples
examples = [
    {
        "input": "Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?",
        "output": "what can the members of The Police do?",
    },
    {
        "input": "Jan Sindel’s was born in what country?",
        "output": "what is Jan Sindel’s personal history?",
    },
]
# We now transform these to example messages
example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("human", "{input}"),
        ("ai", "{output}"),
    ]
)
few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate(
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    examples=examples,
)

[code]
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            """You are an expert at world knowledge. Your task is to step back and paraphrase a question to a more generic step-back question, which is easier to answer. Here are a few examples:""",
        ),
        # Few shot examples
        few_shot_prompt,
        # New question
        ("user", "{question}"),
    ]
)

[code]
question_gen = prompt | ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) | StrOutputParser()

[code]
question = "was chatgpt around while trump was president?"

[code]
question_gen.invoke({"question": question})

[output]
'when was ChatGPT developed?'

from langchain_community.utilities import DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper

search = DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper(max_results=4)


def retriever(query):
    return search.run(query)

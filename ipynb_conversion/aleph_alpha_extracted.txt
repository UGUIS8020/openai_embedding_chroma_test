# Aleph Alpha

There are two possible ways to use Aleph Alpha's semantic embeddings. If you have texts with a dissimilar structure (e.g. a Document and a Query) you would want to use asymmetric embeddings. Conversely, for texts with comparable structures, symmetric embeddings are the suggested approach.

## Asymmetric

[code]
from langchain_community.embeddings import AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding

[code]
document = "This is a content of the document"
query = "What is the content of the document?"

[code]
embeddings = AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding(normalize=True, compress_to_size=128)

[code]
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([document])

[code]
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(query)

[markdown]
## Symmetric

[code]
from langchain_community.embeddings import AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding

[code]
text = "This is a test text"

[code]
embeddings = AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding(normalize=True, compress_to_size=128)

[code]
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([text])

[code]
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)

[code]

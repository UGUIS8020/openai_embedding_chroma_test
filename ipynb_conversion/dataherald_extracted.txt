# Dataherald

This notebook goes over how to use the dataherald component.

First, you need to set up your Dataherald account and get your API KEY:

1. Go to dataherald and sign up [here](https://www.dataherald.com/)
2. Once you are logged in your Admin Console, create an API KEY
3. pip install dataherald

Then we will need to set some environment variables:
1. Save your API KEY into DATAHERALD_API_KEY env variable

[code]
pip install dataherald
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community

[code]
import os

os.environ["DATAHERALD_API_KEY"] = ""

[code]
from langchain_community.utilities.dataherald import DataheraldAPIWrapper

[code]
dataherald = DataheraldAPIWrapper(db_connection_id="65fb766367dd22c99ce1a12d")

[code]
dataherald.run("How many employees are in the company?")

[output]
'select COUNT(*) from employees'

# Huawei OBS Directory
The following code demonstrates how to load objects from the Huawei OBS (Object Storage Service) as documents.

[code]
# Install the required package
# pip install esdk-obs-python

[code]
from langchain_community.document_loaders import OBSDirectoryLoader

[code]
endpoint = "your-endpoint"

[code]
# Configure your access credentials\n
config = {"ak": "your-access-key", "sk": "your-secret-key"}
loader = OBSDirectoryLoader("your-bucket-name", endpoint=endpoint, config=config)

[code]
loader.load()

[markdown]
## Specify a Prefix for Loading
If you want to load objects with a specific prefix from the bucket, you can use the following code:

[code]
loader = OBSDirectoryLoader(
    "your-bucket-name", endpoint=endpoint, config=config, prefix="test_prefix"
)

[code]
loader.load()

## Get Authentication Information from ECS
If your langchain is deployed on Huawei Cloud ECS and [Agency is set up](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-ecs/ecs_03_0166.html#section7), the loader can directly get the security token from ECS without needing access key and secret key. 

[code]
config = {"get_token_from_ecs": True}
loader = OBSDirectoryLoader("your-bucket-name", endpoint=endpoint, config=config)

[code]
loader.load()

[markdown]
## Use a Public Bucket
If your bucket's bucket policy allows anonymous access (anonymous users have `listBucket` and `GetObject` permissions), you can directly load the objects without configuring the `config` parameter.

[code]
loader = OBSDirectoryLoader("your-bucket-name", endpoint=endpoint)

[code]
loader.load()

[output]
'The agent memory consists of two components: short-term memory and long-term memory. The short-term memory is used for in-context learning and allows the model to learn from its experiences. The long-term memory enables the agent to retain and recall an infinite amount of information over extended periods by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.'

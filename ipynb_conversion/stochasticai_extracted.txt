# StochasticAI

>[Stochastic Acceleration Platform](https://docs.stochastic.ai/docs/introduction/) aims to simplify the life cycle of a Deep Learning model. From uploading and versioning the model, through training, compression and acceleration to putting it into production.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `StochasticAI` models.

You have to get the API_KEY and the API_URL [here](https://app.stochastic.ai/workspace/profile/settings?tab=profile).

[code]
from getpass import getpass

STOCHASTICAI_API_KEY = getpass()

[output]
 ········


[code]
import os

os.environ["STOCHASTICAI_API_KEY"] = STOCHASTICAI_API_KEY

[code]
YOUR_API_URL = getpass()

[output]
 ········


[code]
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms import StochasticAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

[code]
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

[code]
llm = StochasticAI(api_url=YOUR_API_URL)

[code]
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

[code]
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"

llm_chain.run(question)

[output]
"\n\nStep 1: In 1999, the St. Louis Rams won the Super Bowl.\n\nStep 2: In 1999, Beiber was born.\n\nStep 3: The Rams were in Los Angeles at the time.\n\nStep 4: So they didn't play in the Super Bowl that year.\n"

 'selected_modules': 'To solve the task of identifying the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, the following reasoning modules are crucial:\n\n1. **Critical Thinking (10)**: This involves analyzing the SVG path commands and coordinates logically to understand the shape they form. It requires questioning assumptions (e.g., not assuming the shape based on a quick glance at the coordinates but rather analyzing the path commands and their implications) and evaluating the information provided by the SVG path data.\n\n2. **Analytical Problem Solving (29)**: The task requires data analysis skills to interpret the SVG path commands and coordinates. Understanding how the "M" (moveto) and "L" (lineto) commands work to draw lines between specified points is essential for determining the shape.\n\n3. **Creative Thinking (11)**: While the task primarily involves analytical skills, creative thinking can help in visualizing the shape that the path commands are likely to form, especially when the path data doesn\'t immediately suggest a common shape.\n\n4. **Systems Thinking (13)**: Recognizing the SVG path as part of a larger system (in this case, the SVG graphics system) and understanding how individual path commands contribute to the overall shape can be helpful. This involves understanding the interconnectedness of the start and end points of each line segment and how they come together to form a complete shape.\n\n5. **Break Down the Problem (9)**: Breaking down the SVG path into its individual commands and analyzing each segment between "M" and "L" commands can simplify the task. This makes it easier to visualize and understand the shape being drawn step by step.\n\n6. **Visualization (not explicitly listed but implied in creative and analytical thinking)**: Visualizing the path that the "M" and "L" commands create is essential. This isn\'t a listed module but is a skill that underpins both creative and analytical approaches to solving this problem.\n\nGiven the SVG path commands, one would analyze each segment drawn by "M" (moveto) and "L" (lineto) commands to determine the shape\'s vertices and sides. This process involves critical thinking to assess the information, analytical skills to interpret the path data, and a degree of creative thinking for visualization. The task does not directly involve assessing risks, long-term implications, or stakeholder perspectives, so modules focused on those aspects (e.g., Risk Analysis (14), Long-term Implications (8)) are less relevant here.',
 'adapted_modules': 'To enhance the process of identifying the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, the reasoning modules can be adapted and specified as follows:\n\n1. **Detailed Path Analysis (Critical Thinking)**: This module focuses on a meticulous examination of the SVG path commands and coordinates. It involves a deep dive into the syntax and semantics of path commands such as "M" (moveto) and "L" (lineto), challenging initial perceptions and rigorously interpreting the sequence of commands to deduce the shape accurately. This analysis goes beyond surface-level inspection, requiring a systematic questioning of each command\'s role in constructing the overall shape.\n\n2. **Path Command Interpretation (Analytical Problem Solving)**: Essential for this task is the ability to decode the SVG path\'s "M" and "L" commands, translating these instructions into a mental or visual representation of the shape\'s geometry. This module emphasizes the analytical dissection of the path data, focusing on how each command contributes to the formation of vertices and edges, thereby facilitating the identification of the shape.\n\n3. **Shape Visualization (Creative Thinking)**: Leveraging imagination to mentally construct the shape from the path commands is the core of this module. It involves creatively synthesizing the segments drawn by the "M" and "L" commands into a coherent visual image, even when the path data does not immediately suggest a recognizable shape. This creative process aids in bridging gaps in the analytical interpretation, offering alternative perspectives on the possible shape outcomes.\n\n4. **Path-to-Shape Synthesis (Systems Thinking)**: This module entails understanding the SVG path as a component within the broader context of vector graphics, focusing on how individual path commands interlink to form a cohesive shape. It requires an appreciation of the cumulative effect of each command in relation to the others, recognizing the systemic relationship between the starting and ending points of segments and their collective role in shaping the final figure.\n\n5. **Sequential Command Analysis (Break Down the Problem)**: By segmenting the SVG path into discrete commands, this approach simplifies the complexity of the task. It advocates for a step-by-step examination of the path, where each "M" to "L" sequence is analyzed in isolation before synthesizing the findings to understand the overall shape. This methodical breakdown facilitates a clearer visualization and comprehension of the shape being drawn.\n\n6. **Command-to-Geometry Mapping (Visualization)**: Central to solving this task is the ability to map the abstract "M" and "L" commands onto a concrete geometric representation. This implicit module underlies both the analytical and creative thinking processes, focusing on converting the path data into a visual form that can be easily understood and manipulated mentally. It is about constructing a mental image of the shape as each command is processed, enabling a dynamic visualization that evolves with each new piece of path data.\n\nBy adapting and specifying these reasoning modules, the task of identifying the shape drawn by the SVG path element becomes a structured process that leverages critical analysis, analytical problem-solving, creative visualization, systemic thinking, and methodical breakdown to accurately determine the shape as a (D) kite.',
